# Development Project Roadmap 

## Sprint #1: Checkmark when completed
  - [x] Create repositories in designated area
  - [x] Compile sources and libaries of common projects that will be beneficial to creators
  - [x] Retrieve data from a database that is useful to utilize for project
  - [x] Access Github for code repositories that will be compatible for development needs. These repositories will be recycled and modified: 
      - Hello-Doctor: https://github.com/ShahariarRabby/Hello-Doctor
      - GenMedi: https://github.com/shakirul15-311/GenMedi
      - MedGen: https://github.com/vickydeshpande8/MedGen
      - Disease-Symptom Knowldge Database: https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html 
      - Bigpharma-steward: https://github.com/peterkomar-hu/bigpharma-steward
      - Pain-Management-Help: https://github.com/ksu-hmi/Pain-Management-Help
      - Covid-19/Flu/Allergy Symptom Checker: https://github.com/Luweyh/Covid19-Symptom-Checker.git
 - [x] Attempt any codes

## Sprint #2: Checkmark when completed
- [x] Each person must make updates in repository 
- [x] Add commit messages
      - Each commit should include a comment that explains what you did (what your update was and what you did)
- [x] Each person must make at least 6 code changes of significant size 
- [x] Paste URLs to 2 code commits 
- [x] Complete codes and run
- [x] Try to successfully run codes to operate software

## Sprint #3: Checkmark when completed
- [ ] Powerpoint slides
- [ ] Introduce our Topic and the market about the topic
- [ ] Create a copy of powerpoint in the github repository


## Findings:
### List code name, URL, description of what code does, and findings
### Only include codes that will be used in this project
- Covid-19/Flu/Allergy Symptom Checker: https://github.com/Luweyh/Covid19-Symptom-Checker.git
    - This Python code is set up to identify whether a patient's symptoms point towards Covid-19, Flu, or Allergies. The system works by asking the user if       they are experiencing a symptom and then the user inputs y/n depending on whether they are experiencing the prompted symptom or not. After all             symptoms are presented to the user, the system will outut whether the symptoms point towards Covid-19, Flu, or Allergies. 
    - This code would be great to use for the purpose of our project. This Python code will give us direction on how to set up our symptom checker.
