# Patient_Treatment_Prescreening_Tool

## Project Description
The development of this software would assist patients by helping them differentiate common cold symptoms from Covid-19 symptoms. In addition, if the patient's symptoms point towards a common cold then the system will recommend over the counter (OTC) medications based on the patient’s symptoms. The system would function first, by having a patient input their symptoms. Then the output will return recommended OTC medications based on the entered symptoms or will tell the patient to contact their doctor if symptoms point towards something more serious. This prescreening tool will let the patient know if their symptoms point towards a common cold or Covid-19. If the patient is experiencing symptoms of Covid, a message will be outputted advising the patient to contact their provider. The software would function as a prescreening tool for clinics, as well as provide insight on at-home care for patients. From the clinic's standpoint, the software would give healthcare providers information on symptoms a patient is experiencing before the patient even comes into the office. In addition, it would provide insight on whether the patient’s health situation is severe enough to come in for an appointment. If the patient is experiencing common cold symptoms, the software will be able to output OTC medication(s) that could be used to treat the patient’s symptoms. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is to alleviate the stress patients encounter when selecting the best OTC medication and assist patients with differientiating common cold and Covid-19 symptoms. Many patients have little knowledge on medications, making it challenging to select the most benefitial medicine. This tool will provide patients with the best recommended OTC medicine for their symptoms. For patients whose symptoms are too severe to be treated by OTC medicines or they are experiencing Covid symptoms, our prescreening tool will give those patients direction to go see their provider. Ideally as a result of the guidance our software provides, patients will experience better health outcomes. Our software will also help providers know what symptoms a patient is experiencing before they even physically see the patient, making the patient examination process much quicker. 

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository and open in Github Desktop
2. Install Visual Studio Code
3. Using Github Desktop, open Patient_Treatment_Prescreening_Tool repository in Visual Studio Code. 
4. Open the following file: Final_Code.py
5. Open new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
6. Run Final_Code.py and then you will be presented with a serious of questions. Answer "y" for yes or "n" for no. 

**At the end, you will be told whether your symptoms point towards a common cold or Covid-19, as well as recommended OTC medicines if you chose to request that information.
